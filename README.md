Requirements

- Use https://uselessfacts.jsph.pl/ to fetch random facts
- Display a list of random facts on the landing page
- The list should start as a single item, and allow a user to click a button to retrieve the next fact
- Clicking on a fact should add / remove the fact as a favourite
- Add a filter to filter between all facts and favourite facts
- Allow the user to change the language of the facts
- Refreshing the page should not lose the state of the facts
- Bonus, build an infinite scroll function to fetch more facts whenever the screen is not fully populated
